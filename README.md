# Profexor — High-Fidelity Website Clone

A production-grade static site clone of a Frankfurt-based hybrid production studio, rebuilt with full fidelity to the original design and interactions.

Built by **[Profexor](https://profexor.cloud)**.

---

## Overview

This project is a high-fidelity static site reconstruction featuring:

- **WebGL 3D Logo** — GPU-accelerated particle simulation using Three.js and custom GLSL shaders
- **GSAP + ScrollTrigger** — Smooth scroll-driven animations throughout
- **Custom Web Components** — `<c-logo>`, `<c-shuffle-chars>`, and other interactive elements
- **Vite-bundled CSS + JS** — Compiled production assets with module preloading
- **Fully static HTML** — No server-side rendering, no framework dependencies at runtime

## WebGL System

The 3D logo animation uses a custom GPU particle simulation built on Three.js:

- **GPGPU particles** — Position computed on GPU via `GPUComputationRenderer`
- **DRACO decoder** — Compressed `.glb` model loading
- **Post-processing** — Custom `EffectComposer` pipeline with shader passes
- **ASCII render mode** — Optional ASCII character rendering mode
- **Mobile detection** — WebGL gracefully disabled on mobile

Source files live in `wp-content/themes/gl/resources/js/GL/`.

## Media Assets

Video and image uploads are excluded from this repository (see `.gitignore`).

The site references media from `wp-content/uploads/` — host these via CDN or local storage when serving the site.

## Running Locally

This is a fully static site — serve it from any HTTP server:

```bash
# Python (no dependencies)
python3 -m http.server 8080

# Node.js
npx serve .
```

Note: WebGL requires serving over HTTP (not `file://`) due to browser security restrictions on `fetch()`.
